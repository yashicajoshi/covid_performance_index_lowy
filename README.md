Lowy institute Covid performance index measures the comparative effectiveness of countriesâ€™ handling of the COVID-19 pandemic using a number of criteria. The two R scripts apply the same methodology to Indian states to track performance across all Indian states.

Methodology of Lowy Covid Performance Index:
To gauge the relative performance of countries at different points in the pandemic, the index tracked six measures of COVID-19.

Fourteen-day rolling averages of new daily figures were calculated for the following indicators:

1. Confirmed cases
2. Confirmed deaths
3. Confirmed cases per million people
4. Confirmed deaths per million people
5. Confirmed cases as a proportion of tests
6. Tests per thousand people

Collectively, these indicators point to how well or poorly countries have managed the pandemic. An equally weighted average of the rankings across the six indicators was normalised to produce a score between 0 (worst performing) and 100 (best performing) on any given day in the 43 weeks that followed their hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19.

A score of 100 indicates that a country achieved the best average score across the six indicators compared to all other countries examined at a comparable point in time. Conversely, a score of 0 indicates that a country had the worst average score at a given moment during the pandemic.
